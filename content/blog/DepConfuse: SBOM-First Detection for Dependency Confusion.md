## Introduction
Dependency confusion attacks continue to be a significant risk in software supply chains. They occur when an internal package name or namespace is not claimed by the company in a public registry, allowing a malicious package  to be published under the same name. While many companies attempt to secure their software supply chains, this type of vulnerability often goes unnoticed until it causes damage.

## Current Challenges
Most existing tools for detecting dependency confusion are built for specific ecosystems and depend on files like lockfiles. They work well for a single language, but in an organization with a multi-language ecosystem, detection becomes challenging and often requires multiple tools.

## Solution: DepConfuse
DepConfuse takes a fundamentally different approach by leveraging SBOMs. Instead of parsing source code or lockfiles, it analyzes CycloneDX SBOMs and uses PURL metadata to identify potentially vulnerable internal packages.

## Why SBOMs Matter
SBOMs list all components, libraries, and dependencies in a standard format, making them the backbone of software composition analysis. By using SBOMs, DepConfuse can work across different ecosystems, scale to hundreds of applications, and integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines or security tools.

## How DepConfuse Works

DepConfuse parses CycloneDX SBOMs or text files containing PURLs, extracting package information including type, namespace, and name. It then queries the [ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms/) API to check whether the packages exist in public registries. If a package is not found, it indicates a potential dependency confusion vulnerability where an attacker could register a malicious package with the same name. The tool supports over 20 package ecosystems, including npm, PyPI, and Maven, providing comprehensive coverage across modern software supply chains.
